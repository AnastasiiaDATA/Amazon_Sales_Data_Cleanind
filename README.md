# Amazon_Sales_Data_Cleaning
Cleaning and preparing Amazon sales data for analysis.
## Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and preparing Amazon sales data for further analysis. The goal is to ensure the dataset is free of errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies, making it ready for analytical or machine learning tasks.

---

## Objective
- Identify and clean errors in the raw sales data.
- Prepare the dataset for accurate analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant entries.
- Document the entire process for reproducibility and learning.

---

## Dataset Details
- **File Used**: Amazon_Sale_Report.csv  
- **Size**: 26.2 MB  
- **Content**: Raw Amazon sales data with columns such as product IDs, sales prices, categories, and order details.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Loading the Data**:
   - Imported the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
   - Reviewed the structure of the data (rows, columns, data types).

2. **Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values in key columns.
   - Removed duplicate rows.
   - Standardized column names for better readability.
   - Fixed data type mismatches.

3. **Preparation**:
   - Added calculated fields (if applicable).
   - Created a cleaned version of the dataset for future analysis.

---

## Results
- Reduced dataset size by removing duplicates and irrelevant data.
- Addressed missing values, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

---

## Files in This Repository
- **Raw_Data.csv**: The original dataset.
- **Cleaned_Data.csv**: The final cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
- **Data_Cleaning_Notebook.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook documenting all steps.

---

## Tools Used
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook.

---

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Data_Cleaning_Notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Review the cleaning process or use the cleaned dataset (`Cleaned_Data.csv`) for analysis.

---

## Future Improvements
- Automating the cleaning process using Python scripts.
- Adding visualization to highlight data quality before and after cleaning.
